					<h3>Fenway Park</h3>
					<p>Fenway Park is the oldest Major League baseball park in the United States. Its small, intimate atmosphere really allows you to feel like you are "in the game." On a warm summer night there is nothing better than going to the park, sipping a beer and watching the game. The park is situated right in downtown Boston - so it is very accessible if you are visiting the area. Tickets to the game can be difficult to get, so check with your hotel concierge about getting tickets before heading over to the park.</p>

					<h3>Boston Symphony Orchestra</h3>
					<p>Now in its 132nd season, the Boston Symphony Orchestra gave its inaugural concert on October 22, 1881, and has continued to uphold the vision of its founder, the businessman, philanthropist, Civil War veteran, and amateur musician Henry Lee Higginson, for well over a century.</p>

					<h3>Boston Pops</h3>
					<p>The Boston Pops was founded in 1885 as a second, popular identity of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO), founded four years earlier. Consisting primarily of musicians from the BSO, although generally not the first-chair players,[1] the orchestra performs a Spring season of popular music and a holiday program in December, the BSO schedule on break at those times. For the Pops, the seating on the floor of Symphony Hall is reconfigured from auditorium seating to banquet/cafe seating. In addition the Pops also plays an annual concert at the Hatch Shell on the Esplanade every Fourth of July. Identified with its long-time director Arthur Fiedler, in the past the orchestra has recorded extensively, made frequent tours, and appeared regularly on television. The Pops Spring and Holiday seasons allowed the BSO to become one of the first American orchestras to provide year-round employment for its musicians.</p>
